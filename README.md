## Project Description
Our full-stack project is a period tracker website which allows users to track their cycles, read articles and comment on them. We want to facilate healthy conversation and increase general knowledge of female health through the use of selected articles and comment.

Our wireframe shows that when the webpage is first loaded, the user is able to see the animated clouds and the login/sign-up modal buttons.
Once the user is logged in, they will taken to the cycles page and the navigation bar changes.
