        The length of the menstrual cycle varies from woman to woman, but the average is to have periods every 28 days. Regular cycles that are longer or shorter than this, from 23 to 35 days, are normal.
        
        The menstrual cycle is the time from the first day of a woman's period to the day before her next period.
        
        Girls can start their periods anywhere from age 8 upwards, but the average is around 12 years. The average age for the menopause (when periods stop) in this country is 51.
        
        Between the ages of 12 and 52, a woman will have around 480 periods, or fewer if she has any pregnancies.</p>

        To understand the menstrual cycle, it helps to know about the reproductive organs inside a woman's body. These are: </p>

<p>
        <li>2 ovaries= where eggs are stored, developed and released</li>
        <li>the womb (uterus) = where a fertilised egg implants and a baby develops</li>
        <li> the fallopian tubes = two thin tubes that connect the ovaries to the womb</li>
        <li> the cervix = the entrance to the womb from the vagina</li>
        <li> the vagina</li>
        </p>

        The menstrual cycle is controlled by hormones. In each cycle, rising levels of the hormone oestrogen cause the ovary to develop and release an egg (ovulation). The womb lining also starts to thicken.

        In the second half of the cycle, the hormone progesterone helps the womb to prepare for implantation of a developing embryo.

        The egg travels down the fallopian tubes. If pregnancy doesn't occur, the egg is reabsorbed into the body. Levels of oestrogen and progesterone fall, and the womb lining comes away and leaves the body as a period (the menstrual flow).

        The time from the release of an egg to the start of a period is around 10 to 16 days.
